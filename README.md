# Geolocation

This use case compares the use of geolocation in Python and R. Geolocation is the identification of the geopgraphic location of an object. The data used in this example is a list of the top 100 cities for murder in Pennsylvania. This data contains the number of murders and murders per 100,000 residents for each city. Both scripts run strings which contain the names of the cities through the Google Maps API, which returns the latitude and longitute. The cities are plotted on maps to display the geographical location of the city along with other visuals to display the murder data.
